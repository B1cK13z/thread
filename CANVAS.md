# Thread Open Canvas

Open Canvas is a strategic planning tool designed to refine and crystallize project ideas, particularly in community-driven and collaborative contexts. Adapted from the Lean Canvas, a format commonly used for startup business projects, Open Canvas is uniquely tailored for projects driven by community participation and volunteer contributions, aligning with the core principles of working open.

In crafting an Open Canvas, you'll populate a one-page template with essential project details, considering both your project's product aspects and its community dynamics. This tool serves as a bridge between your project vision and a concrete plan, fostering clarity and resource alignment.

Open Canvas is a vital step in the journey toward creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for your project. MVP, originating from the startup realm, emphasizes the development of a basic, functional version of your project that fulfills essential goals. While you may harbor grander ambitions for your project's future, such as expansive features or extended offerings, focusing on the MVP first allows you to validate your project's viability before committing extensive resources.

In cases where your project seems too complex to fit within the Open Canvas model, this might indicate that it's time to refine your project scope and concentrate on building a solid foundation before venturing further. Open Canvas equips you with the strategic clarity to start strong and stay agile as you navigate the intricate landscape of community-driven projects.

The Open Canvas concept was developed by [Abby Cabunoc Mayes](https://github.com/abbycabs) as part of the [Mozilla Open Leaders Program](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/develop-an-open-project-strategy-with-open-canvas/)

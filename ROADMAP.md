# Thread Roadmap

## Project Mission & Summary:
Thread is an open-source initiative dedicated to enhancing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) mapping by automating the process of linking cybersecurity reports and articles to MITRE ATT&CKÂ®. Our mission is to empower security professionals, organisations, and analysts by providing efficient, empowering, and community driven CTI capabilities.

## Milestones:

### Milestone 1: Enhanced IoC capture 
1. Conduct customer feedback analysis to identify IoC capture improvement areas.

   - Objective: To align our IoC capture capabilities with the specific needs of our user community.
   - Notes: As part of the feedback we received, there were IoCs being captured that needed further parsing, and there was also private, multicast and link-local addresses being captured as they are included in the reports Thread is consuming. This highlights the need for transparency in CTI, but also means that Thread needs to improve capabilities to improve the quality of IoCs.

2. Develop and implement IoC capture improvements based on feedback.

   - Objective: Enhance Thread's ability to capture and catalogue Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from analysed reports.
   - Notes: This is currently being worked on.
  
3. Run a comprehensive testing and validation phase for the IoC capture enhancements.

   - Objective: Ensure the reliability and accuracy of the IoC capture feature.
   - Notes: We have performed user acceptance testing of some functionality changes and will continue to do so as the IoC work is refined.

### Milestone 2: UX design optimisation
1. Conduct a thorough UX audit of the current Thread interface.

   - Objective: Identify pain points and areas of improvement in the user experience.

2. Collaborate with UI/UX designers to revamp the Thread interface for improved usability.

   - Objective: Streamline the user interface to simplify navigation and user interactions.

3. Implement user testing to gather feedback on the redesigned UX.

   - Objective: Validate the effectiveness of the UX improvements based on user feedback.

4. Continuously iterate on the design based on user input and further testing.

   - Objective: Ensure that the Thread interface aligns with user preferences and needs.

### Milestone 3: Documentation update 
1. Review and assess existing documentation to identify gaps and outdated information.

   - Objective: Ensure that Thread users have access to accurate and up-to-date resources.

2. Revise and expand documentation to encompass recent functionality changes.

   - Objective: Provide comprehensive guidance on Thread's enhanced capabilities.

3. Create new tutorials and guides to assist users in maximising Thread's potential.

   - Objective: Empower users to leverage Thread effectively for their threat intelligence needs.
   - Notes: This might be covered in the second task. Once the documentation review is completed it can be determined if further guides and tutorials are needed.

### Milestone 4: Performance optimisation
1. Investigate and diagnose performance bottlenecks causing Thread to hang during concurrent operations.

   - Objective: Enhance Thread's overall stability and responsiveness.

2. Implement optimisations to address identified performance issues.

   - Objective: Ensure that Thread operates smoothly, even when handling multiple tasks concurrently.

3. Continuous monitoring and fine-tuning to maintain optimal performance.

   - Objective: Sustain Thread's responsiveness and reliability as usage scales.

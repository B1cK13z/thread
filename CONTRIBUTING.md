## Issue tracking

We use GitHub issue tags to categorise our issues and pull requests. Please use these tags when creating or working on issues to help streamline the work that goes into building Thread and the community.

Below are the tags we use:

* bug: If something isn't working as expected or there's a malfunction, tag the issue as a bug. Be sure to provide detailed information about the problem.
* community: These tags are used for community building efforts, such as organising events, discussions, or initiatives aimed at fostering our community.
* config change: Use this tag for requests to change configuration settings. Clearly describe the requested changes in the issue.
* dependencies: Tag for pull requests that update a dependency file, such as libraries or external resources. Provide information on the dependency and the reason for the update.
* documentation: Issues related to improvements or additions to documentation. Use this tag for discussions and tasks related to enhancing our documentation.
* duplicate: If you find that an issue or pull request already exists for the same problem or request, tag it as a duplicate.
* enhancement: Tag for issues related to performance improvements, code refactoring, or enhancing usability without introducing new features.
* feature request: Tag for new feature requests to our software or services. Please provide clear details about the proposed feature.
* good first issue: This tag identifies issues suitable for newcomers to the project. If you're new to our community, consider starting with these issues to get acquainted with contributing.
* help wanted: Tag for issues that require extra attention or assistance from the community. If you're looking for a way to contribute, check out these issues.
* invalid: If an issue doesn't seem valid or relevant, tag it as invalid. Provide a brief explanation of why the issue is considered invalid.
* question: If you have questions or need further information about an issue or topic, tag it as a question. Feel free to ask and engage in discussions.
* review: Issues or pull requests that are pending review. Use this tag when you've submitted your work, and it's awaiting feedback or approval from maintainers. Alternatively feel free to add the tag at any time you would like a maintainer to look over the issue.
* testing: Issues related to software testing, test cases, or compatibility checks. Use this tag when discussing testing procedures or reporting test-related problems.
* ui/ux: Issues related to user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. Use this tag when discussing design improvements or reporting UI/UX issues.
* wontfix: Tag for issues that will not be addressed or worked on. Use this tag when a proposed change or feature doesn't align with project goals or priorities.

If you're unsure which tag to use, feel free to ask for guidance in the comments.

## Bug Handling Process

Bugs are inevitable in any software project, and we appreciate your help in identifying and resolving them. To streamline bug reporting and resolution, we follow a structured process:

1. Check for Existing Issues. 

Before reporting a new bug, please search our issue tracker on GitHub to see if someone has already reported the same issue. If you find a similar issue, you can add a comment with additional information if necessary.

2. Create a New Issue.

If you couldn't find an existing report for your bug:

* Go to our GitHub repository and click on the "Issues" tab.
* Click "New Issue" to create a new bug report.
* Use the Bug Report Template: We have provided a bug report template to ensure you include essential information for our team to understand and reproduce the issue.

3. Provide Detailed Information

When creating a bug report, please provide as much detail as possible:

* Title: A concise, descriptive title.
* Description: A detailed description of the bug, including what you expected to happen and what actually happened.
* Reproduction Steps: Clear steps to reproduce the bug. This helps us isolate the issue.
* Environment Information: Include details about your environment, such as operating system, browser version, or software version.
* Screenshots or Error Logs: If applicable, include screenshots or error logs to illustrate the problem.

4. Label the Issue

Our team will review your bug report and apply appropriate labels, such as "bug" and any relevant tags (e.g., "ui/ux," "dependencies").

5. Discussion and Resolution

Once the bug report is submitted, our team will review it and engage in discussion if additional information or clarification is needed. 

6. Fix and Testing

If the bug is confirmed, a contributor or maintainer will work on a fix. After implementing the fix, it will undergo testing to ensure the issue is resolved without introducing new problems.

7. Closed and Verified

Once the fix is confirmed and tested, the issue will be marked as "closed." You will be notified of the resolution, and you can verify the fix on your end.

8. Participate in Discussions

Feel free to participate in discussions related to the bug. Your insights and suggestions are valuable in making the project better.

9. Contributor Recognition

As a token of our appreciation, contributors who actively help identify and resolve bugs may be recognised and credited in our project.

Thank you for helping us improve our software. Your diligence in reporting and verifying bugs contributes to the stability and reliability of our project.

## Feature Request Process

Feature requests are a valuable way to improve Thread's functionality and meet the needs of our users. We follow a similar structued process for features:

1. Check for Existing Requests

Before submitting a new feature request, please search our GitHub issue tracker to see if someone has already proposed a similar feature. If you find a similar request, you can add a comment with additional thoughts or use cases.

2. Create a New Feature Request

If you couldn't find an existing feature request for your idea:

* Go to our GitHub repository and click on the "Issues" tab.
* Click "New Issue" to create a new feature request.
* Use the Feature Request Template: We have provided a feature request template to help you include essential details about your proposal.

3. Provide Detailed Information

When creating a feature request, please provide as much detail as possible:

* Title: A concise, descriptive title that summarises the proposed feature.
* Description: A detailed description of the feature, including its purpose, benefits, and use cases.
* Use Cases: Explain scenarios where this feature would be valuable or necessary.
* Implementation Ideas: If you have suggestions on how to implement the feature, please share them.
* Alternatives: Mention any alternative solutions or workarounds you've considered.
* Visual Aids: If applicable, include diagrams, mock-ups, or screenshots to visualize the feature.

4. Label the Issue

Our team will review your feature request and apply appropriate labels, such as "feature request" and any relevant tags (e.g., "ui/ux," "enhancement").

5. Discussion and Feedback

Once your feature request is submitted, our team and the community may engage in discussions to better understand the proposal, refine the idea, or explore alternative approaches. Feedback from the community is invaluable in this process.

6. Evaluation

Feature requests will be evaluated based on their alignment with project goals, technical feasibility, and potential impact on users. Not all feature requests may be implemented, but each one will be carefully considered.

7. Implementation and Testing

If a feature request is approved for implementation, it will be added to the project's development roadmap. A contributor or maintainer will work on implementing the feature, followed by testing to ensure it functions as intended.

8. Notification

You will be notified about the progress of your feature request, including when it's assigned, in development, and tested. You can follow the discussion and implementation process on GitHub.

9. Contributor Recognition

We value your contributions, including feature requests. Contributors who actively participate in discussions and provide valuable input may be recognised and credited in our project.

Thank you for helping us enhance our project. Your feature requests play a vital role in shaping the future of Thread.

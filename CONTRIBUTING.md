# Contribute
Thank you for wanting to contribute to Thread! 

## Project Mission & Summary:
Thread is an open-source initiative dedicated to enhancing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) mapping by automating the process of linking cybersecurity reports and articles to MITRE ATT&CKÂ®. Our mission is to empower security professionals, organizations, and analysts by providing efficient, empowering, and community driven CTI capabilities.

## Code of Conduct
The Thread community has adopted the Contributor Covenant. Before contributing, please read the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to the Thread community you agree to the code of conduct.

## Resources
Please see the [README](README.md) for high level information about Thread, and the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) to get an understanding of where the project is going.

## Communication channels
Coming Soon!

# Ideas for possible topics

## Getting started
* Is there anything we've not already said that someone needs to know to help them get started?
* Do we need to give them instructions on setting up their dev environment for any Thread particulars?

## Types of contributions
* The types of contributions we would like, such as code, documentation, bug reports, feature requests. Anything else?
* We will need guidelines for each type of contribution.

## Coding standards
Anything to add here?

## Issue tracking
* How will issues are tracked? We will use a tagging system, anything else? 
* How will reported bugs be handled?
* How feature requests are handled? I'm happy for there to be a process where both of us discuss features and build them into our roadmap. We may need something like "Features will be discussed at our fortnightly maintainers catchup and we will reply to the request to let you know if it is something that will be incorporated into Thread, and if so where it fits into the roadmap." This gives people a cadence they can expect, and it means we will also need to formalise calls and put regular review calls in place.
* What will the workflow be for submitting, reviewing, and merging contributions?

For the tagging system, here are some suggested tags as a first pass:
* Good first issue
* Bug
* Feature Request
* Documentation: Issues related to improving or updating documentation, such as README files, user guides, or API documentation
* UI/UX: This tag is for issues related to user interface (UI) or user experience (UX) improvements. It can cover design changes, layout enhancements, and usability suggestions.
* Enhancement: We can use this tag for general enhancements or improvements that don't fit strictly into the "feature request" category. It can include performance optimisations, code refactoring, or usability improvements.
* Help Wanted: Indicate issues where help from the community is needed. This tag can be applied to issues that may require additional expertise or effort. We should have a process for monitoring for these if we use this, and state that people should reach out in whatever channel we go with as well.
* Testing: Tag issues that involve testing the software, creating test cases, or ensuring compatibility with different environments or configurations.
* Community: This tag can be used for issues related to community building, collaboration, or discussions. It may include proposals for events, community guidelines, or discussions about project direction. Might seem strange but this is a contribution to the community, not all contributions take the form of code. We should decide if we want this discussion to occur on GitHub, or in anothe channel such as Slack/Discord. Either way it should be called out in these guidelines so people who want to make non-code contributions know what to do.
* Priority
* Security: We have said we want things disclosed to us privately, do we reiterate that here? Do we formalise what that process is?
* Question
* Review Needed
* Duplicate: If an issue is a duplicate of another, we can mark it with this tag to avoid redundancy and track the original issue.
* Invalid: We can use this tag for issues that are deemed invalid or not relevant to Thread.
* Wontfix

## Testing and quality assurance
* How do you want testing handled?
* We will need to talk about what our QA process will be, as in you reviewing code, and how often that will occur so people know when their pull request will be merged in.

## Licence 
Thread is offered under the original TRAM licence, the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE.txt). Please note that all contributions to Thread fall under the Apache License 2.0.

## Recognition and Attribution
* How will contributors be recognised and attributed for their work?
* What contributor acknowledgment or rewards system will we put in place?

## Contact information
How do we want to manage questions people want to ask before contributing? Do we want to have a shared mailbox that we both have access to, and can add others to if they become maintainers over time? Or do we want to handle this in a dedicated channel in our Slack or Discord (if we go with either of those)?

## Submission guidelines

## Bug Handling Process

Bugs are inevitable in any software project, and we appreciate your help in identifying and resolving them. To streamline bug reporting and resolution, we follow a structured process:

1. Check for Existing Issues. 

Before reporting a new bug, please search our issue tracker on GitHub to see if someone has already reported the same issue. If you find a similar issue, you can add a comment with additional information if necessary.

2. Create a New Issue.

If you couldn't find an existing report for your bug:

* Go to our GitHub repository and click on the "Issues" tab.
* Click "New Issue" to create a new bug report.
* Use the Bug Report Template: We have provided a bug report template to ensure you include essential information for our team to understand and reproduce the issue.

3. Provide Detailed Information

When creating a bug report, please provide as much detail as possible:

* Title: A concise, descriptive title.
* Description: A detailed description of the bug, including what you expected to happen and what actually happened.
* Reproduction Steps: Clear steps to reproduce the bug. This helps us isolate the issue.
* Environment Information: Include details about your environment, such as operating system, browser version, or software version.
* Screenshots or Error Logs: If applicable, include screenshots or error logs to illustrate the problem.

4. Label the Issue

Our team will review your bug report and apply appropriate labels, such as "bug" and any relevant tags (e.g., "ui/ux," "dependencies").

5. Discussion and Resolution

Once the bug report is submitted, our team will review it and engage in discussion if additional information or clarification is needed. 

6. Fix and Testing

If the bug is confirmed, a contributor or maintainer will work on a fix. After implementing the fix, it will undergo testing to ensure the issue is resolved without introducing new problems.

7. Closed and Verified

Once the fix is confirmed and tested, the issue will be marked as "closed." You will be notified of the resolution, and you can verify the fix on your end.

8. Participate in Discussions

## Feature Request Process

Feature requests are a valuable way to improve Thread's functionality and meet the needs of our users. We follow a similar structued process for features:

1. Check for Existing Requests

Before submitting a new feature request, please search our GitHub issue tracker to see if someone has already proposed a similar feature. If you find a similar request, you can add a comment with additional thoughts or use cases.

2. Create a New Feature Request

If you couldn't find an existing feature request for your idea:

* Go to our GitHub repository and click on the "Issues" tab.
* Click "New Issue" to create a new feature request.
* Use the Feature Request Template: We have provided a feature request template to help you include essential details about your proposal.

3. Provide Detailed Information

* Implementation Ideas: If you have suggestions on how to implement the feature, please share them.
* Alternatives: Mention any alternative solutions or workarounds you've considered.
* Visual Aids: If applicable, include diagrams, mock-ups, or screenshots to visualize the feature.

4. Label the Issue

Our team will review your feature request and apply appropriate labels, such as "feature request" and any relevant tags (e.g., "ui/ux," "enhancement").

5. Discussion and Feedback

Once your feature request is submitted, our team and the community may engage in discussions to better understand the proposal, refine the idea, or explore alternative approaches. Feedback from the community is invaluable in this process.

6. Evaluation

Feature requests will be evaluated based on their alignment with project goals, technical feasibility, and potential impact on users. Not all feature requests may be implemented, but each one will be carefully considered.

7. Implementation and Testing

If a feature request is approved for implementation, it will be added to the project's development roadmap. A contributor or maintainer will work on implementing the feature, followed by testing to ensure it functions as intended.

8. Notification

You will be notified about the progress of your feature request, including when it's assigned, in development, and tested. You can follow the discussion and implementation process on GitHub.

We value your contributions, including feature requests. Contributors who actively participate in discussions and provide valuable input may be recognised and credited in our project.

Thank you for helping us enhance our project. Your feature requests play a vital role in shaping the future of Thread.

## Contribution Workflow

Thread follows a structured workflow to ensure that contributions are thoroughly reviewed, tested, and integrated effectively. This process is designed to maintain code quality, reliability, and alignment with the project's goals. Here are the key steps in the contribution workflow:

1. Submission

Begin by creating a fork of our repository on GitHub. Next, clone your forked repository to your local development environment using Git. Once you have your local copy, create a new branch within your fork, giving it a descriptive name that relates to your contribution. This branch will serve as the container for the changes you make.

2. Development

To work on your contribution, make your code changes, enhancements, or bug fixes within your dedicated branch. As you make progress, remember to commit your changes regularly, accompanied by meaningful commit messages that describe the purpose and functionality of each commit. This practice helps maintain clarity and transparency throughout the development process.

3. Testing and Documentation

After implementing your code changes, it's crucial to conduct testing to ensure they function as intended and don't introduce new issues. Additionally, if your contribution impacts documentation in any way, please update the relevant documentation to ensure it remains accurate and aligned with the changes you've made. This ensures that users and contributors have access to up-to-date and reliable information.

4. Pull Request (PR)

Once your contribution is ready, it's time to create a PR from your branch to the original project's repository. When doing so, make sure to provide a clear and informative description of your changes within the PR. Explain why these changes are necessary and offer any pertinent details. If your contribution addresses specific issues, be sure to reference those issues in the PR description to facilitate a more efficient review process.

5. Review

After you've submitted your PR, our project maintainers and fellow contributors will review your changes. They will assess your code, offer feedback, and suggest potential improvements. You can engage in discussions with the reviewers. This collaborative process ensures that your work aligns with project standards and objectives.

6. Continuous Integration (CI)

Once you've submitted your PR, our CI system will automatically run tests to evaluate its adherence to our quality standards. Please review the CI results and address any issues or necessary fixes. This step helps maintain the project's overall integrity.

7. Approval

After your PR aligns with the project's criteria and requirements, it will undergo review and receive approvals from project maintainers or designated reviewers. This step signifies that your contribution has been accepted and is on track for inclusion in Thread.

8. Merge

Once the PR is approved, a project maintainer will merge your changes into the main Thread repository, incorporating your contribution into Thread.

9. Closure

Upon merging your Pull Request (PR), any related issues that were addressed by your contribution will be automatically closed. We genuinely appreciate your valuable contribution, and our team extends heartfelt thanks for your effort and commitment to the project!

10. Contributor Recognition

Contributors who actively participate and make significant contributions may be recognised and credited in our project.

By following this structured workflow, you can contribute effectively to Thread, collaborate with the community, and ensure that your contributions align with our quality and coding standards. Thank you for your contributions to Thread!
